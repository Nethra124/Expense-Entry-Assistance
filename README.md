# Expense Entry Assistance

This project focuses on the development of an advanced GPT-based chatbot system designed to automate the task of expense tracking and categorization. Users can describe their expenditures in natural language to the chatbot interface, minimizing manual effort. The application analyzes the user input and accurately categorizes it along with storing the expense details in the database. Real-time graphs dynamically display expense analysis for effective review and management.

Technological Stack:
- Database: PostgreSQL for reliable storage and retrieval of expense data.
- Backend: Flask for smooth data handling and interaction with the application.
- Chatbot Interface: Streamlit for a user-friendly experience (API - Google PaLM).
